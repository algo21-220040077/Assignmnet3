Algorithm Trading Assignment3

Bitcoin being extremely volatile makes it harder to predict. I aim to use the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) which states that stock market prices are largely driven by new information and follow a random walk pattern. By incorporating social media as an additional channel of information we can better emulate the speculative patterns of the traders. For example the fall in prices of bitcoin with the Chinese regulatorâ€™s decision to bad all virtual currency and its subsequent rise when the government decided to soften it stands.
